- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick Saveleski.
- 📍 I currently live in Denver, CO but will be moving to Maryland after July 31, 2021.
- 👀 I’m interested in furthering my knowledge and skills in Sass, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS3 and web design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Sass, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, HTML5/CSS3, and website accessibility to make the web more understood through the use of screen-readers. 
- 🖇 Projects outside of general practice will be found here as I develop more for the community of businesses around me. 
- 📫 How to reach me nicksaveleski@gmail.com
